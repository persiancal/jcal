.SH NAME
jstrptime \- convert a string representation of jalali date and time to a jalali time jtm structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.BI "char *jstrptime(const char *" s ", const char *" format ,
.BI "struct jtm *" jtm );
.sp
Link with -ljalali
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR jstrptime ()
function is the converse function to
.BR jstrftime (3)
and converts the character string pointed to by
.I s
to values which are stored in the
.I jtm
structure pointed to by
.IR jtm ,
using the format specified by
.IR format .
Here
.I format
is a character string that consists of field descriptors and text characters,
reminiscent of
.BR scanf (3).
Each field descriptor consists of a
.B %
character followed by another character that specifies the replacement
for the field descriptor.
All other characters in the
.I format
string must have a matching character in the input string.
There should be white\%space or other alphanumeric characters
between any two field descriptors.
.PP
The
.BR jstrptime ()
function processes the input string from left
to right.
Each of the three possible input elements (whitespace,
literal, or format) are handled one after the other.
If the input cannot be matched to the format string the function stops.
The remainder of the format and input strings are not processed.
.PP
The supported input field descriptors are listed below.
In case a text string (such as a weekday or month name)
is to be matched, the comparison is case insensitive.
In case a number is to be matched, leading zeros are
permitted but not required.
.TP
.B %%
The
.B %
character.
.TP
.BR %a " or " %A
The weekday name in abbreviated form or the full name.
.TP
.BR %b " or " %B
The month name in abbreviated form or the full name.
.TP
.BR %d " or " %e
The day of month (1-31).
.TP
.B %H
The hour (0-23).
.TP
.B %j
The day number in the year (1-366).
.TP
.B %m
The month number (1-12).
.TP
.B %M
The minute (0-59).
.TP
.B %s
Seconds since UTC Epoch.
.TP
.B %S
The second (0-59).
.TP
.B %y
The year within century (0-99).
When a century is not otherwise specified, values in the range 19-99 refer
to years in the fourteenth century (1319-1399); values in the
range 00-18 refer to years in the fifteenth century (1400-1418).
.TP
.B %Y
The year, including century (for example, 1390).
.LP
The broken-down jalali time structure \fIjtm\fP is defined in \fI<jtime.h>\fP
as follows:
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
struct jtm {
    int tm_sec;        /* seconds */
    int tm_min;        /* minutes */
    int tm_hour;       /* hours */
    int tm_mday;       /* day of the month */
    int tm_mon;        /* month */
    int tm_year;       /* year */
    int tm_wday;       /* day of the week */
    int tm_yday;       /* day in the year */
    int tm_isdst;      /* daylight saving time */
};
.fi
.in
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The return value of the function is a pointer to the first character
not processed in this function call.
In case the input string
contains more characters than required by the format string the return
value points right after the last consumed input character.
In case
the whole input string is consumed the return value points to the null
byte at the end of the string.
If
.BR jstrptime ()
fails to match all
of the format string and therefore an error occurred the function
returns NULL.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C99.
.SH NOTES
.LP
In principle, this function does not initialize \fIjtm\fP but
only stores the values specified.
This means that \fIjtm\fP should be initialized before the call.
libjalali does not touch those fields which are not
explicitly specified.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates the use of
.BR jstrptime (3)
and
.BR jstrftime (3).
.sp
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <jalali.h>
#include <jtime.h>

int
main(void)
{
    struct jtm tm;
    char buf[255];

    memset(&jtm, 0, sizeof(struct jtm));
    jstrptime("1390\-03\-17 08:33:01", "%Y\-%m\-%d %H:%M:%S", &jtm);
    jstrftime(buf, sizeof(buf), "%d %b %Y %H:%M", &jtm);
    puts(buf);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
